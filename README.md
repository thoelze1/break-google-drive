# Is Google Drive Storage Really "Unlimited?"

Binghamton University claims that the Google Drive storage on my school sponsored account is "unlimited." We'll see.

## How?

At first, I tried uploading huge files to Google Drive using [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive). The average upload speed from my desktop is about 3.0 MB per second; it would take over 3 days to upload a single TB. I began looking for another solution.

Next, I noticed that copying files that are already in Google Drive is much faster (and isn't limited based on internet speed). I will be writing a script to automate copying of a file in Google Drive.
